Readme File
===========

IP-Core packager is a tool which generates component.xml or _hw.tcl files which are description of interface of hardware design usually written in Verilog or VHDL. Result is the package with HDL (Verilog/VHDL) files, constraints files (XDC, UCF, ...) tcl based GUI and package description file. IP-Core packages greatly simplifies integration of hardware projects, all major synthesis tools (Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus, ...) are supporting them directly and for rest it is better to have IP-Core because of consistency.
