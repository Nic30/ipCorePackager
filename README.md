Scriptable universal IP-Core generator

## Export formats
* [IP-XACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP-XACT) (Vivado)
* Quartus (QSys) *_hw.tcl

## What is IP-Core packager.

IP-Core packager is a tool which generates component.xml or _hw.tcl files which are description of interface of hardware design usually written in Verilog or VHDL. Result is the package with HDL (Verilog/VHDL) files, constraints files (XDC, UCF, ...) tcl based GUI and package description file. IP-Core packages greatly simplifies integration of hardware projects, all major synthesis tools (Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus, ...) are supporting them directly and for rest it is better to have IP-Core because of consystency.

## How to use IpCorePackager

IpCorePackager is API for generating of IP-XACT and _hw.tcl files. In order to use the IpCorePackager you need two things.

* You need to have definitions of Interface IP-Core meta for interfaces which require some special care (require to define some parameter in IP-Core, etc.), This meta has to be subclass of [ipCorePackager.intfIpMeta.IntfIpMeta](https://github.com/Nic30/ipCorePackager/blob/master/ipCorePackager/intfIpMeta.py#L19)

* You need to define methods in [ipCorePackager.packager.IpCorePackager](https://github.com/Nic30/ipCorePackager/blob/master/ipCorePackager/packager.py#L142) which are raising the NotImplementedError. This methods are because ipCorePackager does not dependeds on reprenation of design.

This library is used by [hwt](https://github.com/Nic30/hwt) [there](https://github.com/Nic30/hwt/blob/master/hwt/serializer/ip_packager.py) you can find reference implementation of IpCorePackager methods for hwt style hardware description. 

The [hwtLib](https://github.com/Nic30/hwtLib) library contains definitions of [IntfIpMeta descriptions](https://github.com/Nic30/hwtLib/blob/master/hwtLib/peripheral/i2c/intf.py#L95) for common interfaces.
